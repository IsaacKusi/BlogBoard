    <p>This page is about Jesushaus,asynchronous functions run things at once so you can even call a function before even writing
the function bcos it is asynchronous....when it comes to synchronous functions, everything
must be in order. You write a function before you call it since this sync. function
run things in order.
so in actual fact you can do the getItems in the usetate function where you set the default
items. Such that whenever the page is refreshed it will set getting Items from the localStorage
as default but  before that make sure you written the useEffect function. Also functions
are not only gotten from the useEffect....you can setItems there as well.</p>
